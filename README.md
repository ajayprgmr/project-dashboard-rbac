# Fixl Solutions Project Management SaaS

A Jira-inspired project management dashboard featuring role-based access, Kanban and table task views, team controls, and analytics – all built with React, Redux Toolkit, and Vite. State is persisted to `localStorage`, allowing mock users to pick up where they left off.

## Feature Highlights
- **Authentication & Roles** – Mock login via Formik + Yup with persisted sessions for Admin, Project Manager, Developer, and Viewer personas. Admins can impersonate any account.
- **Projects Workspace** – Card/table views with filters, role-aware CRUD, and quick member insights.
- **Tasks Board** – Drag-and-drop Kanban (planner, in-progress, review, done) plus a sortable table view with filters and developer-only status updates.
- **Teams Hub** – Project-level rosters with role badges, task counts, and assignment dialog (admin + owning PM control).
- **Reports & Analytics** – Recharts dashboards for completion trends, project status mix, and top contributors, driven by async mock API calls.
- **Global UI Polish** – Responsive MUI shell with sidebar navigation, dark/light toggle, global search, and toast notifications for key actions.
